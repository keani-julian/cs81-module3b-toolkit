//What patterns/surprises did I notice?
- I noticed patterns: functions with parameters are reusable and predictable which overtime became easier to get used to.
- Recursion (if used) was tricky at first, but breaking down the steps and going over it repeatedly helped. 

//What logic challenge you're thinking?
- Making functions flexible for negative or zero inputs.

//How might this kind of tool could be used in the real world?
- These small functions can form the building blocks for larger calculations or apps that can do more dynamic things like improving user experience through design and features for users.
